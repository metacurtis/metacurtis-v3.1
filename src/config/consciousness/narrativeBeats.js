    personalStory: `I was in third grade. It was the end of summer, the sunlight softer and golden—the kind of light you only see as fall begins. Pure curiosity drew me to my friend's house in Dallas. There, by the window, sat an old computer and his mom's programming book. The cursor blinked, as if waiting for a question.

I followed the steps, typed my first line of code. When I pressed Run, the program actually worked. In that moment, wonder and exhilaration—like unlocking a secret. Computers were rare, almost mythical. For me, that single spark became a memory, engraved in my hippocampus, lying dormant for 42 years. This was Genesis.`,
